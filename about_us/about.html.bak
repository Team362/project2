      <h4 id="history">History and Goals:</h4>
      <p id="history-txt">
        The International Society for Universal Dialogue was founded in Warsaw, Poland in 1989.
        ISUD is a philosophical society dedicated to promoting international and intercultural
        dialogue among an ever-wider segment of humanity. The main purpose of the society is to
        pursue, by means of scholarly work, the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and
        just world order. Towards this goal, ISUD produces biannual international conferences to
        facilitate an ethos of universal dialogue. Along with this ISUD is also a member of the
        International Federation of Philosophical Societies (FISP), which is an international
        association of philosophers and scholars from a wide range of other disciplines (such as
        history, archaeology, pedagogy, anthropology, etc) devoted to promoting the discussion of
        such fundamental issues as world peace, social justice, human rights, and dialogical
        interrelations of diverse cultures.
